# Real Estate Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting residential property prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes housing data from three U.S. states — Florida, Virginia, and Idaho — and contains detailed features related to each property. Using this dataset, I have built and trained a predictive model to estimate house prices based on property characteristics.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of housing market data with the following features:

Feature	Description
type -	Type of property (e.g., house, apartment)
status -	Sale status (e.g., sold, available)
year_built -	Year the property was constructed
soldOn -	Date the property was sold
sqft -	Property size in square feet
stories -	Number of stories
baths -	Number of bathrooms
beds -	Number of bedrooms
listPrice -	Market listing price (target variable)
state -	U.S. state where the property is located (Florida, Virginia, Idaho)

## Objectives
Develop a machine learning model to predict house prices.
Explore relationships between property features and pricing.
Provide an easy-to-use pipeline for training and prediction.

## Model and Approach
The dataset is preprocessed to handle categorical variables and missing values.
Various ML algorithms were tested.
The final model is trained using Random Forest Regressor (or specify your model if different).
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as R² score.
